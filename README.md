-----------

### Requirements

Uses the Ruby libraries `chef/search/query`, `ipaddr` and `uri`


### Attributes

`osops_networks` is a list of network names and associated CIDR. These are used in the `get_ip` functions.
`osops`: `apply_patches` Set to true to apply RCB patches to installed packages.  Default is false.
`osops`: `do_package_upgrades` Set to true to upgrade certain packages during a chef run.  Default is false.


### Usage

```ruby
node['osops_networks']['localnet'] = 127.0.0.0/8
node['osops_networks']['management'] = 10.0.1.0/24
ip = get_ip_for_net("localnet")  # returns 127.0.0.1
ip = get_ip_for_net("management") # returns the address on management, or error
node['osops']['apply_patches'] = true
```


autoetchosts
------------

This is included by nova::nova-common


### Usage

```ruby
include_recipe "osops-utils::autoetchosts"
```


patching
--------

Provide a mechanism for hot patching a file that may be part of a package.  Any changes will most likely be overwritten when the package is updated.

### Usage

```ruby
template "/usr/share/pyshared/nova/scheduler/filters/affinity_filter.py" do
  source "patches/affinity_filter.py.2012.1+stable~20120612-3ee026e-0ubuntu1.2"
  owner "root"
  group "root"
  mode "0644"
  notifies :restart, resources(:service => "nova-scheduler"), :immediately
  only_if { ::Chef::Recipe::Patch.check_package_version("nova-scheduler","2012.1+stable~20120612-3ee026e-0ubuntu1.2",node) ||
            ::Chef::Recipe::Patch.check_package_version("nova-scheduler","2012.1+stable~20120612-3ee026e-0ubuntu1.3",node) }
end
```
